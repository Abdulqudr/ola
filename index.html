see what i just read, will this be use Quick Start
For new projects, you can set up an app using the @farcaster/create-mini-app CLI. This will prompt you to set up a project for your app.

npm
pnpm
yarn

npm create @farcaster/mini-app
Remember, you can use whatever your favorite web framework is to build Mini Apps so if these options aren't appealing you can setup the SDK in your own project by following the instructions below.

Manual Setup
For existing projects, install the MiniApp SDK:

Package Manager
npm
pnpm
yarn

npm install @farcaster/miniapp-sdk
CDN
If you're not using a package manager, you can also use the MiniApp SDK via an ESM-compatible CDN such as esm.sh. Simply add a <script type="module"> tag to the bottom of your HTML file with the following content.


<script type="module">
  import { sdk } from 'https://esm.sh/@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'
</script>
Making Your App Display
After your app loads, you must call sdk.actions.ready() to hide the splash screen and display your content:


import { sdk } from '@farcaster/miniapp-sdk'
 
// After your app is fully loaded and ready to display
await sdk.actions.ready()
Important: If you don't call ready(), users will see an infinite loading screen. This is one of the most common issues when building Mini Apps.
